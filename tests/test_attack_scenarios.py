"""
Attack scenario tests demonstrating governance advantages.

These tests show concrete examples where traditional dependency management
fails but governed-stack's cryptographic commitments succeed.

PHILOSOPHY:
- Traditional pyproject.toml/requirements.txt can be edited by anyone
- No cryptographic binding between "who approved" and "what was approved"
- Version drift happens silently across environments
- Supply chain attacks can inject malicious versions undetected

GOVERNED APPROACH:
- Every constraint has a SAID (cryptographic hash)
- Stack SAID changes if ANY constraint changes
- Controller AID binds authorization to the constraint
- Tampering is detectable: recompute SAID, compare
